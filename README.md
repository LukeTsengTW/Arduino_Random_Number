# Arduino_Randomly_Drawing_Numbers

I mainly use it to solve problems in my school life. For example, when a teacher needs to draw lots, they use a lottery box. Some students would secretly remove their number tags. To prevent this issue and ensure fair outcomes, I leveraged my programming skills and Arduino technology to address the problem.

This program is mainly used to solve problems encountered in school life. For instance, when a teacher conducts a draw to ask students questions, he requires a lottery box. However, some students may surreptitiously remove their lottery sticks, leading to an unfair situation.

So, in order to solve such problems, I use Arduino and write programs to address them, which can be considered a practical daily application.

In fact, this set of devices is widely accepted and actively used by many teachers in the classroom. As for the code, you are free to modify and use it as you wish.

本程式主要是用於解決學校生活上的問題，例如像是老師在抽籤問同學問題時，需要一個籤筒，而有些同學會偷偷把自己的籤拿走，這樣就造成了一種不公平。

所以為了解決這樣的問題，我透過 Arduino 與寫程式來解決這樣的問題，算是一種生活上的應用。

實際上這組裝置在班級上也被許多老師廣泛接受並且積極使用，有關於程式碼的部分，你可以隨意修改跟使用。
